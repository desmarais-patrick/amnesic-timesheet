# Software Documentation

The documentation contained in this directory aims to get everyone on the 
same page and explain software decisions when it isn't obvious.
It aims to:

- Record only the essential ğŸ¤²,
- Build on high value first âœ¨, and
- Focus on features now âŒ›, not those of the future.

Topics have been divided into:

1. [Requirements](./requirements.md)
1. [Design and architecture](./design-and-architecture.md)
1. [Test plan and test cases](./test-plan-and-test-cases.md)

Happy reading! ğŸ™‚
