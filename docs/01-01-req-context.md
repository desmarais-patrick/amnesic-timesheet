# 1.1. Context (C)

The *amnesic timesheet* project originated from an idea to 
improve logging the time spent on different work activities.
The motivation behind tracking this time is two-fold:

- Learn about and improve estimating work and capacity 
  (how long could this take?)
- Share this information with managers for project control (are we on track?)


**Why *amnesic*?**

The daily repetition of this work is reflected in the use of *amnesic*.
While saving time logs is not a primary focus, 
it could be useful in later iterations to reflection estimation accuracy.


**C.1. Logging**

The following information is relevant to time logging:

- Start time
- End time
- Time spent on breaks (to subtract from total time)
- Time spent on activities and projects

With this information, we can compute more metrics such as the total time spent
on breaks and the total time spent working. This time is useful to copy over
another timesheet system used by the organization.


**C.2. Planning and estimating**

The following information is relevant to planning and estimating:

- Top priorities and goals
- Time distribution and guidelines
- Schedule with day events (ex. meeting)
- Schedule **breaks** (important for healthy days)
- Steps to accomplish an activity
- Daily activities

With this information, we can get an overview of the expected time to spend
before starting logging our activities and adjust plan as we learn.

**C.3. Reviewing**

The following information is relevant to reviewing:

- Levels of energy when day started and day ended
- Overall feelings during the day (ex. frustrations, happy moments)
- Number of breaks
- Perceived productivity
- Estimation effectiveness
- Number of priorities accomplished
- What I am grateful for
- Lessons to take from the day
- Feedback notes and points of improvements
- Progress towards short-, medium- and long-term goals (big picture)

The review helps with introspection and requires a step back.
This is quite useful to balance positive and negative perceptions in a day.

The target users are office workers, such as software developers.
Such users may aim to improve their estimation skills or learn about their
capacity to better answer how much work they can take.
